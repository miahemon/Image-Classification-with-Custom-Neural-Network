# Image-Classification-with-Custom-Neural-Network

Step1: All essential libraies are imported according to my project from Tensorflow and ImageDataGenerator performing data augmentation while loading imagedata simultaniously is used for preprocessing train and validation(known as test data in ML) datasets 

Step2: Customised CNN model is built importing Sequential from Tesorflow where input layer, convolution layer, filter, acitivation function(relu, flatten and softmax) are used.

Step3: model compile, save, train and evaluation steps are completed.
